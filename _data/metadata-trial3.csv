coll001,nine_dragons_image.jpeg,Nine Dragons,Chen Rong,1244,"Handscroll, ink on colour and paper, 1244, 46.8 x 1496.5 cm","Chen Rong is perhaps the most well-known dragon painter from the Song Dynasty, with Nine Dragons being one of his most impressive pieces. This dynamic hand scroll details nine dragons in action amongst swirling clouds, jagged mountains, and turbulent waves. In Daoist religion, dragons had close ties with rain, and images of dragons would be used to summon rainfall. This relationship is hinted at in the brushstrokes, where ink splatters in the clouds are reminiscent of raindrops. We can find another connection with the seventh dragon from the right, who is battling the Gate of Yu. Created by Yu the Great, who established the Xia Dynasty and instigated flood control in China, this gateway allowed water from channels to better flow into the ocean. In the painting’s inscription, Chen Rong expresses how it seems as though only a god could have painted these dragons, which could also speak to how he perceived the role of the artist in summoning rain. As the one who depicts the dragons, the artist gains a god-like control dictating natural elements of the world as well.",handscroll; colour; paper,"Museum of Fine Arts, Boston",Image; StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,https://scrolls.uchicago.edu/view-scroll/49
coll002,auspicious_dragon_rock_image.jpeg,Auspicious Dragon Rock,Emperor Huizong (attributed),Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127),"Handscroll, ink and colour on silk, 53.9 x 127.8 cm","On the right of the painting is a detailed illustration of a dragon rock, whose twisting figure seems to imitate the form of a dragon and whose pattern of crevices look like dragon scales. Some grass grows from a pool of water at the top of the rock. Taking up the left half of the painting is an inscription, detailing the the Song Emperor Huizong’s inspiration for the image and a poem inspired by it. In the twelfth century, Huizong’s catalogue of his imperial art collection consisted of an entire chapter dedicated to dragon paintings. Auspicious Dragon Rock took part in a larger collection of Huizong’s Auspicious Omens paintings. This collection was meant to use paintings, prose, and poetry to depict heaven’s approval of his reign. The use naturalism in this painting—an emphasis on realistic representation—could then suggest an argument or desire for his celestially-approved rule to be seen as real.",handscroll; colour; silk,"The Palace Museum, Beijing",Image; StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://101.201.65.88/collections/collections/2013-01-24/1207.html
coll003,immortal_riding_a_dragon_image.jpeg,Immortal Riding a Dragon,Ma Yuan,Southern Song Dynasty (1250-1279),"Hanging scroll, ink and colour on silk, 108.1 x 52.6 cm","In this painting, an immortal sits on the back of a dragon in the centre of the panel, flying majestically through the sky. The immortal looks and leans towards at a figure to his left. A demon servant holds a tall staff with a dragon head and lunges forward at the dragon and immortal, attentive and alert. A sun or moon sits behind the immortal’s head, casting a halo on him, and linking him to higher celestial beings. Dragons were often seen as transportation devices for gods. In Daoist tradition, humans who attained perfection were also imagined to ascend to heaven via dragon. The figures are comparatively small against the vast background, highlighting a sense of freedom and possibility in their travels. This imagery almost conveys a fantasy for Daoists, a looking glass into what they can hope to achieve.",hanging scroll; colour; silk,"National Palace Museum, Taipei",Image; StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Immortal_Riding_a_Dragon.jpg#:~:text=Title-,Immortal%20Riding%20a%20Dragon,the%20dragon%20has%20just%20emerged."
coll004,dragon_tiger_image.jpeg,Dragon; Tiger,Muqi Fachang (attributed),Southern Song Dynasty (1250-1279),"Hanging scroll, ink on silk, 123.8 x 55.9 cm","Although attributed to Muqi, this pair of paintings bears no artist signature nor stamp on its body. Thus, it remains uncertain who these paintings were executed by and when. Still, the pairing of a dragon and tiger speaks to a common visual motif in Daoist iconography, where the two animals were often portrayed as opposite yet complimentary figures. Dragons were associated with fire, the east, and yang (masculinity); tigers symbolized water, the west, and yin (femininity). In legend, Zhang Daolin, the founder of Daoism, went to the Longhushan (Dragon and Tiger Mountain) to practice alchemy. When he succeeded in creating his elixer, a dragon and tiger suddenly appeared by him. Within this pair of paintings, the water waves at the bottom right of Dragon and the stick at the top left of the Tiger seem to contradict each animal’s nature. However, this entanglement of supposed binaries is also present in the yin and yang symbol, Tying the two separate panels together emphasizes a sense of harmony and balance from the dragon and tiger.",hanging scroll; silk,"The Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland",Image; StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1958.427
coll005,"nine_songs_of_qu_yuan_image.jpeg",Nine Songs of Qu Yuan,Zhang Dunli (attributed),Southern Song Dynasty (1250-1279),"Handscroll, ink and colour on silk, 24.7 x 608.5 cm","The Nine Songs was originally a set of poems attributed to Qu Yuan. The entire handscroll is also composed of nine paintings, each followed by a verse or verses from the poems that are related. The image featured here is the first composition, which consists of a procession—including some more humanistic and other almost demonic figures—surrounding a dragon who is drawing a chariot for The Great Unity—the god of the Ch’u State as well as the allegorical hero for the verse that follows this image (wearing a black hat and red robe). Unrolling the handscroll would first show the dragon’s torso in the midst of all the other figures, before revealing its head as the panel’s final face. The dragon becomes overpowered in this image, both in terms of composition and the harness that binds its body. While emphasizing the strength of another (The Great Unity), this dragon is relegated to a servant position.",handscroll; colour; silk,"Museum of Fine Arts, Boston",Image; StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,https://scrolls.uchicago.edu/view-scroll/59
