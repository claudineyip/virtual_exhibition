## About the Virtual Exhibition

Dragons have been an emblem of Chinese culture for thousands of years. With Daoist religious roots and imperial connotations, the dragon has maintained several functions depending on the depiction and user. This virtual exhibition aims to consider different historical motivations and uses of dragons during the Song Dynasty. In doing so, it will create a broader image of what dragons could symbolize for artists and the public during this time. Examining these paintings will also help to understand some of the social and political circumstances that helped produce them. 
Nine Dragons explores the relationship between fantasy, religion, and rain. Dragon; Tiger offers an opportunity to compare dragons to another animal, and further examine ideas and perceptions of fantasy. While Auspicious Dragon Rock doesnâ€™t explicitly depict dragons, it uses the connotations associated with the animal to suit specific political motivations. Immortal Riding a Dragon and Nine Songs of Qu Yuan both provide examples of human-dragon interactions. 
This exhibition will explore how dragons were perceived in the Song Dynasty, and how this fantastical creature creates opportunities to craft specific narratives to suit the needs of the artist. At the same time, it will question what depictions of dragons can tell us about their role both within the larger hierarchy of animals and compared to humans in general.
