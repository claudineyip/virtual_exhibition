## About the Virtual Exhibition

As dragons have become an overt symbol for Chinese culture, their meanings have simplified into connotations of strength and power. This virtual exhibition aims to consider different historical motivations and uses of dragons during the Song Dynasty. In doing so, it will create a more well-rounded picture of what dragons could mean for artists and the public during this time. Examining these paintings will also help to understand some of the social and political circumstances that helped produce them. Nine Dragons explores the use of repetition as well as the relationship between fantasy and religion. Dragon; Tiger offers an opportunity to compare dragons to another animal, and further examine ideas and perceptions of fantasy. While Auspicious Dragon Rock doesn’t explicitly depict dragons, it uses the connotations associated with the animal to suit specific political motivations. Immortal Riding a Dragon and Nine Songs of Qu Yuan provide examples of illustrations depicting human-dragon interactions. This exhibition will examine what these interactions can tell us about how dragons were perceived in the Song Dynasty—the human relationship with this mythical creature? At the same time, what can depiction of dragons with other animals tell us about their role within the larger hierarchy of animal (and animal paintings) in general?
